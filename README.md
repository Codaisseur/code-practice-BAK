At [Codaisseur][codaisseur], we focus mostly on classroom learning to teach
people code because of the high levels of quality and support that we can give
students when we are physically present. Still, we decided to start building
this online learning experience together with some of our grads.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Learning about code, algorithms, software architecture, frameworks, 100's of
libraries in a short time is demanding and rewarding, but in the end it also
comes down to spending those 10K hours on writing code to become a craftsperson.

This project will provide a place to practice.

## Development

To run this project do the following.

```bash
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
